// COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR CHALLENGE
1. initialize int variable, named result, to value of 10
2. use compound operator, with minus sign, to subtract a number from result, use value of your choice
3. print out the result

// IMPLEMENTATION JSHELL
jshell> {
   ...>     int result = 10;
   ...>     result-=5;
   ...>     System.out.print("result = " + result);
   ...> }
result = 5

// WHEN RESULT IS INT, GIVE US DIFFERENT VALUE
jshell> {
   ...>     int result = 10;
   ...>     result -= 5.5;
   ...>     System.out.print("result = " + result);
   ...> }
result = 4

- fixing the problem by initilizing variable as double
- an implicit cast is done when using this operator, no error occurs but result is unexpected
jshell> {
   ...>     double result = 10;
   ...>     result -= 5.5;
   ...>     System.out.print("result = " + result);
   ...> }
result = 4.5
