// VARIABLES //

keyword: any one of a number of reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the Java language
java syntax: 
	- code is case-sensitive
	- int is a keyword in Java
variable: way to store information in computer
data types: keywords in Java
declaration statement: 
	- define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name
	- optionally set the variable to a specific value
expression: a coding construct that evaluates to a single value
declaring variables:
	- declaring a variable again is effectively re-declaring a variable
	- in Java programming, this is NOT allowed and will throw an error
	- this statement includes the data type (ie. int)
operators: Java operators perform an operation on a variable or value
case sensitive: 
	- Java code is case sensitive and variables will always be exactly as declared
	- keywords need to be lowercase

// PRIMITIVE TYPES //

// get the valid range for int, -2147483648 to 2147483648
// Integer is a wrapper class
jshell> int myMinIntValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
myMinIntValue ==> -2147483648
jshell> int myMaxIntValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
myMaxIntValue ==> 2147483647

// java statement System.out.print will print different data types together
// integer variables get converted to String
jshell> System.out.print("Integer minimum value = " + myMinIntValue);
Integer minimum value = -2147483648

// print statement with range
jshell> System.out.print("Integer value range (" + myMinIntValue + " to " + myMaxIntValue + ")" );
Integer value range (-2147483648 to 2147483647)

// CLASSES //
class: 
	- building block for object-oriented programming, enables building of custom data types
	- Java uses concept of wrapper class for all eight of its primitive data types
