// LOGICAL "AND" OPERATOR AND THE LOGICAL "OR" OPERATOR
- both operators have two flavours in Java
- && is the Logical and, which operates on boolean operands, checking 
- || is the Logical or, operates on boolean operands to check if given condition is true or false
- |  is the bitwise operator, also working at the bit level (will likely not be used as much)
