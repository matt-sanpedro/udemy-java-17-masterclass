// PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES FOR STORING WHOLE NUMBERS

DATA TYPE 	WRAPPER CLASS 		NOTEWORTHY
--------- 	------------- 		----------
byte		Byte			Has the smallest range
short		Short
int		Integer			Default data type for whole numbers
long 		Long			Has the largest range

// UNDERFLOW/OVERFLOW
	- both byte and short have same overflow and underflow issues as the int data type has, but with own range of numbers

// SIZE OF PROMITIVE DATA TYPES AND WIDTH
- size or width is the amount of space taht determines (or limits) range of values

DATA TYPE	WIDTH		MIN VALUE		MAX VALUE
--------- 	-----		---------		---------
byte 		8 		-128 			127
short		16 		-32768 			32767
int		32		-2147483648		2147483647

// LONG DATA TYPE
	- long myLongValue = 100;
	- however number 100 by default is an int (Java will default literal whole numbers as int data type)
	- in Java, certain numeric literals have suffix appended to value, forces to be different data type
	- long is one of these types and suffix is an "L", also is NOT case sensitive
