// IF-THEN STATEMENTS IN JAVA
- conditional logic: program executes certain section of code, only if the particular test evaluates to TRUE
	> uses specific statements in Java to allow to check a condition
- equality operator (==): tests if two operands are considered equal, and returns a boolean value
- code block: allows more than one statement to be executed, or a block
- example code formatting:
if (expression) {
	// put one or more statements here
}
- bottom-line, ALWAYS use a code block for if statements

// DO NOT WITH IF-THEN
- leave a semi-colon at the end of an if statement line
	> this will end the expression and the condition will not evaluate
- forget to use curly braces to wrap the if condition code block
