// CHAR
- char is different from a string
- literal string from previous notes were use in print statement:
	ex: jshell> System.out.print("Hello World");
- char example on jshell:
jshell> char myChar = 'M';
myChar ==> 'M'

// CHAR VS STRING DIFFERENCES
CHAR					STRING
----					------
holds one, and only one, char		can hold multiple characters
literal enclosed in single quotes	literal enclosed in double quotes

// REASONS FOR CHAR
- can store last key pressed by a user in a game
- loop programmatically through the letters in an alphabet
- can be used to store arrays for looping

// CHAR DATA TYPE
- occupies two bytes of memory, or 16 bits, and thus has a width of 16
- not single byte, stored as 2 byte number, similar to the short
- unicode: an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts
	> each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms/programs
- web resource for unicode: https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table
- can extract the unicode from web resource, sample code:
jshell> char myChar = '\u0044';
myChar ==> 'D'

- can assign a numeric literal to a char variable (ex: from html integer of 'D')
jshell> char myDecimalCode = 68;
myDecimalCode ==> 'D'

// ASSIGNING VALUES TO A CHAR VARIABLE
ASSIGNMENT TYPE				EXAMPLE CODE
---------------				------------
a literal character			char myChar = 'D';
a Unicode value 			char myChar = '\u0044';
an integer value			char myChar = 68;

// SAMPLE CODE ON QUESTION MARK CHAR
jshell> char mySimpleChar = '?';
mySimpleChar ==> '?'

jshell> char myUnicodeChar = '\u003f';
myUnicodeChar ==> '?'

jshell> char myDecimalChar = 63;
myDecimalChar ==> '?'

jshell> System.out.print("My values are " + mySimpleChar + myUnicodeChar + myDecimalChar);
My values are ???
