// BOOLEAN PRIMITIVE TYPE
- in general a boolean is a value that stores two opposite choices: true or false, yes or no, one or zero
- in Java terms, can be set to two values only: true or false
- wrapper for boolean is Boolean with capital B
- example implementation:
jshell> boolean myTrueBooleanValue = true;
myTrueBooleanValue ==> true

jshell> boolean myFalseBooleanValue = false;
myFalseBooleanValue ==> false

// PREFIX: 'is'
- often the word is can be used as prefix for a boolean value
- creates a name that seems to ask question, makes reading the code more intuitive:
jshell> boolean isOverTwentyOne = true;
isOverTwentyOne ==> true
- other common boolean variable names:
	> isEligibleForDiscount, hasValidLicense, isMarried, hasChildren
