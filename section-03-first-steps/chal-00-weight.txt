// CHALLENGE
STEPS:
1. Create a variable with the appropriate type, to store the number of pounds
2. Calculate kilograms, with variable above, and store the result in a 2nd appropriately typed variable
3. Print the result

jshell> double myWeightPounds = 150d;
myWeightPounds ==> 150.0

jshell> double myWeightKilo = myWeightPounds * 0.45359237d;
myWeightKilo ==> 68.0388555

jshell> System.out.print(myWeightPounds + " pounds converted is: " + myWeightKilo + " kilograms");
150.0 pounds converted is: 68.0388555 kilograms
