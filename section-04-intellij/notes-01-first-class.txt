// DISSECTING THE JAVA CLASS
- public: Java keyword called an access modifier
- access modifier: define which parts of code can access a particular element
- class: key word used to define a class, class name will be text following the "class" keyword
- left and right curly braces define the class code block, or class body
- a method was defined in the first class example above as main
- method: collection of statements, one or more, that perform an operation
- main method: Java will run this method when program is executed and is the entry point for ANY Java code
- static: Java key word used for memory management primarily
	> can be applied to varialbes, methods, blocks, and nested classes
	> when static is declared, belongs to class rather than instances of the class
	> thus, only one instance of the static member exists, regardless of how many objects of the class are created
- void: Java key word to indicate that the method will not return any information
- method declaration: first set of left and right parentheses after main
- code block: location where code is inputted, second set of parentheses
